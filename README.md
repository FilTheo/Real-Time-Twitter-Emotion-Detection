# Real Time Twitter Emotion Detection


**This project was worked with Chris Norrie(b19chrno@his.student.se)**

It presents a geolocation based real-time emotion classification framework

The main idea is to build an emotion-detection framework which on real-time streams every tweet that has a selected hashtag (in our case #Covid19).
First the location of the user is extracted. Then tweets are classified as either happy, angry, sad, or scared 

The acquired information is loaded through elasticsearch into a Kibana's Dashboard offering various analytics.

An example of its usage is given below:

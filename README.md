# Real-Time-Twitter-Emotion-Detection
The project  attempts to determine general public opinion about any topic in terms of the emotions inferred from relevant tweets. User picks a topic in terms of a representive hashtag and a streaming pipeline is initiliazed. Tweets containing the selected hashtag are streamed, pre-processed and fed into a double Layer Bi-LSTM NN trained to classify tweets as happy, sad, angry or fearful. Afterwards, an ElasticSearch Index is created and user can use the defined Kibana's dashboard to explore how the emotion of users alter depending on geolocation or time.
